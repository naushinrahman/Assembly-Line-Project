# Assembly Line Project
- The **assembly line** consists of a set of **workstations** each of which holds a set of stock items, which are specific to the station.
- An assembly line is ran by a **line manager** which takes in **customer orders** and moves them along the line, filling the orders at each station.
- Each customer order consists of a list of **items** that need to be filled.
- Each workstation has a limited amount of stock of the items it fills.
- At the end of the line orders are either completed or incomplete: the simulator lists the completed orders and those that are incomplete once the line manager has finished processing all orders.
