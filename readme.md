# Assembly Line Project
The **assembly line** consists of a set of **workstations** each of which holds a set of stock items, which are specific to the station. A **line manager** moves **customer orders** along the line filling the orders at each station, as requested. Each customer order consists of a list of items that need to be filled. At the end of the line orders are either completed or incomplete due to a lack of inventory at one or more stations. The simulator lists the completed orders and those that are incomplete once the line manager has finished processing all orders.
